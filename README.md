# 📦 Smart Inventory Management System for Quick Commerce  
*A Machine Learning-Based Demand Forecasting Simulation*

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a **backend-only proof-of-concept** developed to demonstrate how **AI-powered forecasting** can help quick commerce companies maintain the right inventory and avoid stockouts. Using **dummy sales data** and **machine learning models**, this system predicts next-day product demand based on historical trends.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This system was not built for public or production use. It was created as a **technical marketing asset**—showcasing the possibilities of machine learning in retail and logistics operations. There is **no frontend UI**; the entire functionality exists in the form of **Python scripts and notebook workflows**.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The following ML models were trained and tested using synthetic sales data:

- **Linear Regression** – A baseline model for trend prediction.
- **Random Forest Regressor** – Captures nonlinear trends and patterns.
- **XGBoost Regressor** – High-performance gradient boosting model used for final predictions.
